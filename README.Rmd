## Installation

You can install the released version of ezcox from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("ezcox")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ShixiangWang/ezcox")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to get result from a batch of cox models.

```{r example}
library(ezcox)
data("lung", package = "survival")

# Build unvariable models
ezcox(lung, covariates = c("age", "sex", "ph.ecog"))

# Build multi-variable models
# Control variable 'age'
ezcox(lung, covariates = c("sex", "ph.ecog"), controls = "age")
```
